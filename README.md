# Weather and Server-Side APIs!
## About
Nice Project, working with server side API's can be rough but enjoyable once you get it working! really enjoyed this one. I kept it pretty basic with the css and js. didn't have much time this week! newly learned syntax below:
- dayjs.extend(window.dayjs_plugin_utc);
- dayjs.extend(window.dayjs_plugin_timezone);
- fetch(Url)
- .then(function)
--- 
Looking forward to applying these skill into deeper and more clomplex applications. 4 Star Project, would recommend !
